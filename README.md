# Josh's dot file stash #
I've been using version control for the dot files in my home directory for a long
time. I've also been using one of my own systems as a central repository for
syncing dot files between machines. Recently though, I've been using far more
machines then I used to. So, it was time for a change and I get a kick out of
reading other people's .vimrc files on github. Seems appropriately I should join
in and base my syncing off github.

For my own edification incase I forget everything or I wonder what it was I've
done: I link these files to the expected files that normally exist in the .vim
directory and my home directory. Currently, I manually do the linking since I
work on a total of three machines. Perhaps in future I should write a script to
take care of these steps.
