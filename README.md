# Josh's dot file stash #
I've been using version control for the dot files in my home directory for a long
time. I've also been using one of my own systems as a central repository for
syncing dot files between machines. Recently though, I've been using far more
machines then I used to. So, it was time for a change and I get a kick out of
reading other people's .vimrc files on github. Seems appropriately I should join
in and base my syncing off github.
